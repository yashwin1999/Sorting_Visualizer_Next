Sorting Visualizer Next (Sorting Comparison)
=======================

Sorting Visualizer Next is an interactive web application for visualizing various sorting algorithms. Built with Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS, and Chart.js, this tool helps users understand sorting algorithms through real-time visualizations.


Overview
--------
This project enables users to visualize different sorting algorithms with options to:
- Select and compare sorting algorithms.
- Adjust settings like speed and array size.
- View animated sorting processes in a real-time graph.

Setup Instructions
------------------
1. **Download and Unzip**:
   - Unzip the downloaded file to your preferred directory.

2. **Open sorting_visualizer_next folder in any IDE**:
   - Use any IDE and open the folder sorting_visualizer_next,open the terminal and make sure the directory points to the main folder "sorting_visualizer_next".

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Open a terminal in the project directory.
   - Run the following command to install all required dependencies:
     ```
     npm install
     ```

Running the Application
-----------------------
1. **Start in Development Mode**:
   - To run the app in development mode, use:
     ```
     npm run dev
     ```
   - Open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000 to view the app.

     ```
3. **Start in Production Mode**:
   - After building, start the production server with:
     ```
     npm start
     ```

Using the Application
---------------------
1. **Insert the number of comparisons required**:
   - Type in the number of comparisons required (number of sorting algorithms to be compares at once) required in the first text box. The maximum number of comparisons allowed is 7 because there are 7 algorithms.

2. **Insert Array Size**:
   - Type the size of array that should be used in sorting and comparing.

3. **Select Sorting Algorithm**:
   - Choose a sorting algorithm from the list of available options in the applicationâ€™s interface, each interface can hold different algorithms.

4. **Generate the random array for the given array size**:
   - Click on "Generate" to generate a random array for the provided input size.

5. **Run the Sort**:
   - Click on "Start" to begin the visualization.
   - The application will animate the sorting process in real time.

Project Structure
-----------------
- **/pages**: Main pages of the application.
- **/components**: Reusable components including the sorting visualizer.
- **/utils**: Utility functions like the array generator.
- **/public**: Static assets such as images and icons.
